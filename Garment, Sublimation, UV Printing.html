<h1> Group Design Challenge </h1>
<br>

<p> This week I learned three fun skills: how to print a shirt, how to sublimate, and how to use UV printer.

<p> I put the picture of my homecoming date and I in the Coredraw and use UV printer to print it. I gave it to her as an extra gift.

<p> For the sublimation, I design the image by putting the Juventus logo and add 3 lines on each side. Then I printed it by using the Coredraw. The mechine I use is sublimation.
	<br>After I printing it, I put the mug in the cool water to cool it down. It's one of my favarioute products so far. 
	<br>
	
  <br>It looks very cool, not only cool to look, but also cool to use.

<p>For printing shirt, we were not allowed to use any image online that has copyright, because this shirt was for commercial competition. 
  <br> So I deisgn my own. I use the photoshop and put the title that WRA gets and set the color green. I print it on the Brother GT-361 printer.
  <br>Sadly, I made a mistake in printing the first line, stating that WRA is the best private school in Ohio.
